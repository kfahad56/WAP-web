We were astonished at the speed of delivery of such a small item at zero delivery charge."

E-commerce is growing at an unprecedented rate all across the world. The supply chain remains the online businesses’ best means of providing customer satisfaction and earn brand loyalty. It also merits attention as to how these ecommerce platforms are fulfilling such quick deliveries, what hurdles they have to overcome, and what are the future opportunities that can be tapped to improve efficiency and increase profitability. One such opportunity which is going to be a game-changer for the internet era is “On-Demand Warehousing”."

It is not possible to buy all storybooks for my son so I take books on demand from a library and there are many such examples. The term on-demand implies getting access to goods and services as and when required."

          "desc": "On-demand Warehousing is the ability to get warehousing services as per the business requirement. It gives retailers and brands a scalable, flexible warehousing solution. It relies on a marketplace model and transactional pricing so that retailers and brands can expand and contract their networks as needed. Its three principal components are storage, fulfilment, and last mile delivery. This implies if a company has taken on-demand warehousing facility they would be entitled to getting space for storage, transportation, and should they choose, also a team for delivering till the doorstep of the customer. What makes the model so exciting is its flexible nature, where the business owners can scale up to meet the peak demand and scale down when the demand reverts to normal levels. The business owners can optimize production and inventory levels thus an on-demand warehousing model helps the seller to keep the cost under control and meet the customers’ expectations at the same time."

They can pay for the warehouse space, fulfilment and retail distribution required presently. Companies also have access to real-time inventory at each warehouse, and an option to scale up or down depending on business needs. Ancillary functions like redistribution, re packaging and warehouse optimization are also available as additional options."

        {
          "desc": "● Adapting to sudden demand changes: It is amazing how fast the demand can change but can the supply chain keep up to the rapid changes? As much as the companies use Artificial Intelligence, Demand projection tools to forecast demand and plan ahead, supply chain disruptions are inevitable. This is where on-demand warehousing comes in and gives businesses a short-term solution for their storage options, fulfilment and retail distribution. The sellers can scale up or down at a short notice leading to better resource utilization. They manage to be efficient and profitable during shifts in demand and supply."
        },
        {
          "desc": "● Improving delivery times: Buyers are spoilt for choice & expect the retailers to deliver the goods as soon as possible. In fact, while ordering for daily supplies from Amazon, I was amazed to see an option “Amazon Fresh”. It promised delivery on the same day as ordering. It is no secret today that buying decisions are governed by delivery speed. We all check the delivery date before placing an order. On-demand warehousing helps retailers to choose a warehouse closer to the end user, hence increasing the speed of delivery, decreasing the last mile delivery cost and most importantly enhancing the customer experience."
        },
        {
          "desc": "● Handling Seasonal variations: Some businesses are seasonal in nature like sellers of blankets and woollens. Pre-winter Retail shops are full of customers buying different sizes of woollens, online portals are full of options of different brands, some brands even set up pop-up shops to improve visibility. Last winter, I visited a leading woollen brand store multiple times looking for a particular size and colour of sweater. but every time I got the same reply “Madam, we are out of stock for your requirement”. This is where on demand warehousing can help the retailer to add warehouses to better handle inventory by supporting retail stores and ecommerce platforms during the seasonal requirements."
        },
        {
          "desc": "● Providing flexibility: On demand warehousing helps brands to plan for new initiatives without affecting their current operations. It gives brands an opportunity to test new strategies and enter new markets without any fixed costs or long-term contracts. A retailer can introduce a product and add a fulfilment centre to facilitate sales. if the product doesn’t work, the option of scaling back without affecting the year-round operations always exists while remaining cost efficient. Similarly, a company can also optimise on their cost per unit by planning storage with on demand warehousing. They can only store a minimum level of inventory as per their monthly sales and scale up as required."
        },
        {
          "desc": "● Benefiting businesses with real time inventory visibility and detailed reporting: This is my very recent experience with an online clothing retailer. I ordered two t-shirts for my five-year-old. The order was accepted and the delivery was scheduled for a given date. However, closer to the delivery date, my order was cancelled and I was given a coupon as a goodwill gesture. This is an example of supply chain mismanagement, wherein, the retailer has already sold the available inventory, however, the stock is not updated real time and hence resulted in a poor customer experience. On demand warehousing helps retailers to see their real time inventory across locations. Detailed reporting of sales and in stock inventory helps the companies to replenish in time as well as stack away unused inventory to optimise cost."

          "desc": "With economic uncertainties lingering longer than expected, logistics and supply chain optimization is one of the top priorities for businesses.

        {
          "desc": "However, currently searching for a warehouse traditionally ,is a nightmare as regular brokers have limited inventory and their own nuances. Considering this, most companies are stockpiling as a cautionary measure. If one does happen to find a broker who can help you lease out the required space, the terms and pricing of the lease could act as a major deterrent. Hence, today the need for on-demand warehousing is like never before. It simplifies and expedites the search process and provides maximum flexibility with minimum hassles."

In fact, the warehousing sector is expected to add 40 million square feet of space across the top 8 Indian cities, a recent survey said. While the exponential growth of the warehousing sector has made it easier for companies to deliver goods to customers on time, it has also exposed volumes of inventory to multiple potential risks. Security and Loss prevention has become one of the major concerns of warehouses today.

Across industries, companies procured raw materials from Country A, set up manufacturing units in Country B and sold the finished product worldwide.  Companies had high-flying executives who travelled across the world to meet prospective customers, suppliers and partners, closing lucrative deals for their firms. Business in the globalised economy heralded the use of modern supply chain practices like off-shore manufacturing to improve cost structures."

A pandemic of this magnitude caught companies across industries off-guard and disrupted supply chains across the world, with businesses being affected on both the demand and supply fronts. A market-leading car manufacturer had to shut down seven of its factories in Korea due to qualified vendors’ inability to deliver components for their vehicles’ production. These suppliers were located within Hubei province, where the local Government had implemented a total lockdown during the Covid outbreak. On the demand front, leading retailers had to shut down stores to prevent the spread of the virus. The uncertainty instilled a sense of fear into the hearts and minds of consumers. As a result, while demand for non- essential goods plummeted, the demand for essentials saw a sudden surge as people prepared for the worst.

In India, production of many pharmaceutical products came to a halt as China, the supplier for active pharmaceutical ingredients that are key ingredients for manufacturing pharma products, was locked down. This is a perfect example of why, going forward,  companies will not only look for suppliers from multiple regions, but also prefer to keep higher levels of inventories in warehouses closer to the manufacturing units to avoid supply chain disruption.
